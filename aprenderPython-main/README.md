# Learning _Python_ guide

In this repository I will upload several guides in `.ipynb` format with summaries about the **Python** programming language.
I want to share them with the entire GitHub community and be able to help more people learn about this beautiful and 
useful language.

### How?

The summaries are made with Google Colab and I recommend opening them with this program (in dark mode). But they can 
be opened with any program that supports `.ipynb` notebooks format.

It is best to follow the learning path, studying each unit in order.
You can consult, through the index in each summary, any topic you want to review.
Still, if you are already familiar with the first few Python lessons, you can open any unit and study it or review previous concepts.

* **Important:** All content is in Spanish (Spain)

I hope it helps you in your learning process.

**Thank you!**
